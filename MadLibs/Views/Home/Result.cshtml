<h1>What Happens When A Unicorn Poops?</h1>
<p>Unicorns aren't like other @Model.PluralNoun1;</p>
<p>they're @Model.Adjective1. They look like @Model.AnimalPluralNoun, with @Model.PluralNoun2 for feet</p>
<p>and a @Model.Adjective2 mane of hair. But unicorns are @Model.Color and have a @Model.Adjective3 @Model.Noun1 on</p>
<p>their heads. Some @Model.PluralNoun3 don't believe unicorns are @Model.Adjective4 but I</p>
<p>believe in them. I would love to @Model.Verb1 a unicorn to faraway @Model.PluralNoun4. One thing</p>
<p>I've always @Model.PastTenseVerb about is whether unicorns @Model.Verb2 rainbows, or is their @Model.Noun2 @Model.Adjective5 like any other animal's?</p>
