  2. In the top righthand corner of the list of files, click the Code dropdown menu.
  3. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the URL to the GitHub repo.
  4. On your computer, open Terminal and navigate to the folder where you plan to clone the repo folder.
  5. Type in `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied:

  6. One great application to open your files in is Visual Studio Code. To download VS Code, go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and click on Download in the top righthand corner. From there, choose the download type necessary for your computer and follow the prompts.
